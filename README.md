[![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.3-blue)](https://github.com/UknownGino/ModdedIntegration/releases/latest) [![Download](https://img.shields.io/badge/download-latest-brightgreen)](https://github.com/UknownGino/ModdedIntegration/releases/latest/download/ModdedIntegration.jar)  

A simple Minecraft Plugin that auto-populates the [Essentials](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/essentialsx.9089/)' [items.csv file](https://github.com/EssentialsX/Essentials/blob/2.x/Essentials/src/main/resources/items.csv) with [Forge](http://files.minecraftforge.net/) items and blocks.
# ‚úÖ Requirements
This Plugin needs some dependencies in order to work.
* [Magma 1.12.2](https://magmafoundation.org/#download) or [1.16.5](https://magmafoundation.org/#download)
* [EssentialsX](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/essentialsx.9089/)
# üîÆ How do I use it?
Put the [plugin jar](https://github.com/UknownGino/ModdedIntegration/releases/latest/download/ModdedIntegration.jar) in your plugins folder and start your server.
Now the [Essentials](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/essentialsx.9089/)' [items.csv file](https://github.com/EssentialsX/Essentials/blob/2.x/Essentials/src/main/resources/items.csv) is populated.

To use modded materials with essentials you need to follow the following scheme: `<modID>_<itemID>`  
Example with [Tough As Nails](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tough-as-nails) ‚û† `toughasnails:purified_water_bottle` ‚û† `/give <playerName> toughasnails_purified_water_bottle`
# üìÑ Commands
The only one command that this plugin provides is `/moddedintegration`.

There are different sub-commands for the command:

| Command                       | Action                    | Permission                                    |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `/moddedintegration info`     | Prints Plugin Information | _moddedintegration.command.moddedintegration_ |
| `/moddedintegration reset`    | Resets items.csv          | _moddedintegration.command.moddedintegration_ |
| `/moddedintegration populate` | Forces the population     | _moddedintegration.command.moddedintegration_ |
| `/moddedintegration reload`   | Reloads the config        | _moddedintegration.command.moddedintegration_ |

# ‚öô Configuration
The only thing that can be modified in the **config.yml file** is the `reload-delay` _(default: **10 ticks**)_. The reload delay is the **amount of ticks** between the **items.csv saving** and the **EssentialsX reloading**.
# ‚ùì How it works?
The plugin gets all the modded materials (blocks and items) and puts them into the essentials' [items.csv](https://github.com/EssentialsX/Essentials/blob/2.x/Essentials/src/main/resources/items.csv) file.
# üí° Original idea
The idea of creating this plugin came to me through [this issue](https://github.com/magmafoundation/Magma/issues/311) opened on the [Magma's GitHub](https://github.com/magmafoundation/Magma).
