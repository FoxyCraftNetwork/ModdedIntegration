A Minecraft Plugin to auto-populate the EssentialsX's items.csv file with Forge items and blocks.
# ‚úÖ Requirements
This Plugin needs some dependencies in order to work.
* [Magma 1.12.2](https://magmafoundation.org/#download)
* [EssentialsX](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/essentialsx.9089/)
# ‚ùì How it works?
The plugin gets all of the modded materials (blocks and items) and puts them into the essentials' [items.csv](https://github.com/EssentialsX/Essentials/blob/2.x/Essentials/src/main/resources/items.csv) file.
# üí° Original idea
The idea of creating this plugin came to me through [this issue](https://github.com/magmafoundation/Magma/issues/311) opened on the [Magma's GitHub](https://github.com/magmafoundation/Magma).
